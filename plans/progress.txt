Energy Profiler Progress Log
=============================

2026-01-14 | EP-081 | COMPLETED | Quantization Energy Comparison
- Added precision and quantization_method detection in model_features.py
- Implemented _detect_quantization function to detect FP32, FP16, BF16, FP8, INT8, INT4, MIXED precisions
- Detects quantization methods: gptq, awq, gguf, bitsandbytes
- Added compare_quantization_levels function for energy savings analysis
- Added precision and quantization_method columns to profiling_runs table
- Added database migration to handle existing databases
- Updated ProfileDatabase.create_run to accept precision and quantization_method
- Added /api/profiling/quantization-comparison endpoint
- Added TypeScript types: QuantizationRunData, EnergySavings, QuantizationComparison
- Updated ProfilingRun interface to include precision and quantization_method
- All tests passing: frontend builds successfully, no Python syntax errors
- Note: Apple Silicon M4 Max unified memory may show different quantization benefits vs NVIDIA GPUs
